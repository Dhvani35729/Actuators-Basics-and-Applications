  - "What is an [[actuator]]? "
    - "An [[actuator]] is a functional element which connects the information processing part of an electronic control system with a technical or nontechnical, e.g. biological, process. #what #actuator"
    - "Actuators can be used to control the flow of energy, mass or volume."
    - "The output quantity of an actuator is energy or power, often in the form of a mechanical working potential "force times displacement""
    - "The actuator control is always achieved using **very low electrical power**, ideally without any power consumption, with currents and voltages which are, if possible, microelectronically compatible"
    - "An actuator's functional structure can be described by introducing the elementary functional components "energy controller" and "energy converter""
      - "![](https://github.com/Dhvani35729/Actuators-Basics-and-Applications/blob/master/Chapter_1/reading/media/fig_1.1.png)"
    - "As an actuator is supposed to control flows of matter and energy, an actuator must contain at least one energy controller."
    - "This is why an actuator is usually a series connection of an energy controller and an energy converter."
    - "The common understanding, however, leaves out one important property of actuators, and that is their controllability with a low-power electrical signal"
    - "Subsequently, the term actuator refers often only to the energy converter, whereas the energy controller is called a power amplifier or power circuit. These definitions are not standardized but are accepted and used by the scientific community around the globe."

  - "Actuator as a System Component"
    - "Many controlling tasks that are required in the natural and artificial environment can be described with an open loop control chain"

    - "Automated processes are often controlled by means of a closed control loop"

  - "Actuators in the Fields of [[mechatronics]] and Adaptronics"
    - "The term [[mechatronics]] was first coined by a senior engineer of a Japanese company in 1969, as a combination of mechanism and electronics"
    - "The most commonly used definition emphasizes synergy and states:"
      - "Mechatronics is the synergistic integration of mechanical engineering with electronics and intelligent computer control in the design and manufacture of products and processes. #what #mechatronics"
    - "Microsystem Technology (MST) [[==]] Microelectromechanical Systems ([[MEMS]])"
    - "The importance of micro technology in the field of sensors is obvious ("microsensors"), though it is rather limited in the field of actuators, since the most common actuator, namely those with mechanical output power, will perform only small displacements and/or forces with a micromechanical structure"
    - "Microsystem technology, however, becomes important when it comes to eliminating electronically the imperfections of actuators, such as the dependence on temperature or nonlinear characteristics."
    - "Adaptronics = the generic term for disciplines that are known on an international level under names such as smart materials, smart structures, intelligent systems, etc."
    - "Functional materials, which are characterized by a high potential of functional and application options, are amongst others: shape memory elements; bimetals; electrorheological, magnetorheological, thixotropic, and rheopex fluids; piezoelectric elements; electrostrictors; magnetostrictors; chemochromic, electrochromic, hydrochromic, photochromic, and thermochromic elements; and functional gels"

  - ""Intelligent" and Self-Sensing Actuators"
    - "The conventional actuator consists of the feedforward controller, power electronics and solid-state transducer subsystems"
      - "![](https://github.com/Dhvani35729/Actuators-Basics-and-Applications/blob/master/Chapter_1/reading/media/fig_1.6.png)"
      - "By means of the desired displacement $$s_d$$, the feedforward controller consisting of a linear static transfer characteristic with a constant $$k_s$$ produces an electrical in- put signal $$X_i$$ for the power electronics."
      - "The power electronics generates the energy-carrying output quantity X for the solid-state transducer from the information-carrying electrical input signal $$X_i$$."
      - "The solid-state transducer transforms the electrical energy quantity X into a displacement s against a force F."
    - "However, even in quasi-static operation the actual displacement and the desired displacement usually do not correspond."
    - "Internal imperfections, such as complex hysteretic nonlinearities, and external influences such as load reactions via the surrounding mechanical structure are the main reasons for the deviation between the desired and actual values."
    - "The former imperfection provokes ambiguities between the input and output of the transducer"
    - "The latter one causes an additional deviation in the actual displacement from the desired value due to the finite stiffness of the solid-state transducer."

    - "As in most technical fields, actuators are increasingly designed with the help of computers."
